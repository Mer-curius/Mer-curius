## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Video Gamer and an Average Stellar Blade Photography

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on beating many video games, such as Stellar Blade for the 6th time, No Man's Sky for the first time, even if there is no end, and some other games I do not know. I am also working on getting my Bachelor's Degree but I am already questioning, is my Future Job really worth it, at this state of the World.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many things to fit the requierments for my Degree, along with C++ when I really want to learn the mysteries of Unreal Engine

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on many projects I do not know

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with C++ Programming

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the Lore of Stellar Blade and the magnificent story
